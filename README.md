# Transboundary Water Conflict
#### A Final Project for GOV 1005 (Data) at Harvard University

### Project Summary
Since the 1990s, there has been a precipitous increase in the frequency and severity of water conflicts around the world. Scholars have primarily studied this phenomenon qualitatively and at a regional level, hypothesizing that increased water conflict might be due to scarcity resulting from population increases, economic development, climatic conditions, or anti-democratic governance. This project compiles and analyzes a wide variety of metrics for the 254 major river basins of the world, taking a first step toward evaluating the claims of these qualitative scholars. By showing which factors are correlated with water conflict, this project serves as the groundwork for my senior honors thesis on the governance of transboundary natural resources in the Middle East.
