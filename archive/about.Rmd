### Background
In recent years, journalists, policymakers, and academics have become increasingly worried about the potential for climate-induced water scarcity to cause international conflict. Approximately [1.2 billion people](https://www.un.org/waterforlifedecade/scarcity.shtml) live in water-scarce areas worldwide, and this number is expected to increase significantly under the stress of [climate change](https://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2019/09/23/climate-change-impacts-water/). Some academics have suggested that countries will turn to violent conflict as they attempt to preserve precious transboundary water supplies. Others, led by [Elinor Ostrom](https://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Ostrom.html), winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, have suggested that increased scarcity will motivate states to cooperate with one another as they attempt to collectively govern shared waters.

While many academics have conducted in-depth qualitative case studies of water governance in transboundary river basins—including the Jordan River, Nile River, and Indus River—few quantitative studies have examined the effect of resource scarcity on water conflict. This project aims to fill that research gap using newly-released datasets covering water governance outcomes over the past 200 years. In so doing, it seeks to answer the following question: Is water scarcity correlated with cooperation or conflict between states?

This project's GitHub repository lives [here](https://github.com/wyatthurt/gov1005-final-project).

### The Data
This project draws heavily on the following datasets from the Oregon State University [Program in Water Conflict Management and Transformation](https://transboundarywaters.science.oregonstate.edu/content/data-and-datasets):

* **International Freshwater Treaties Database:** A dataset of over 600 international, freshwater-related agreements, covering the years 1820 to 2007. This dataset provides detailed information on the issues covered by treaties and is coded by river basin, enabling it to be joined with other datasets from OSU.
* **International Water Events Database:** A dataset of water conflicts between 1948 and 2008, which provides information on the source of conflict, duration of conflict, and how resolution was achieved.
* **International River Basin Organization Database:** A dataset of currently-extant international river basin organizations, coded by basin and countries involved, including level and type of collaboration, principal issue(s), date of creation, and a short description of the organization's activities.

This research also uses data from the [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org), accessed using the [wbstats() package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wbstats/index.html) in R.

### Acknowledgements
This project conceptually builds on several of my previous and current research projects, completed under the supervision of Professor William Clark, Professor Rosie Bsheer, Dr. Michaela Thompson, and Dr. Alicia Harley. I am also grateful for the guidance provided by David Kane and Alyssa Huberts as I learned the art of data science and developed this project.

### About Me
I am a third-year undergraduate at Harvard University, pursuing a joint degree in Environmental Science & Public Policy and Near Eastern Languages & Civilizations. My research (and upcoming senior honors thesis) focuses on mechanisms for improving the governance of transboundary natural resources in conflict zones.
