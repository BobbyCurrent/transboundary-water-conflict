#################### Events ##############################

# The "events" data is already in tidy format, but it is very messy. For now, I
# selected the columns relevant to my analysis, set each column to the correct
# type, and recoded appropriate values as NA. Once it becomes clearer which data
# is relevant to my final product, I will be able to further narrow down columns
# and perform even more rigorous data cleaning.

na_strings <- c("NA", "N.A.", "n/a", "?location", "?relvant", ".", " ")

events <- read_csv("raw_data/events_raw.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x %in% na_strings) %>%
  select(!c(id, id1, event_master, event_type)) %>%
  mutate(date = ymd(date), doc_date = ymd(doc_date)) %>%
  mutate(year = year(date))

# I spent several hours attempting to recode messy observations in the
# "event_type" column, before realizing that two other columns ("issue_type1"
# and "issue_type2") provided what I think is the same data in a format that was
# much easier to parse. However, the code is included below in case it is of use
# later.

# See raw_data/events_codebook.doc for a detailed description of each column.

#################### Organizations ##############################

# The "organizations" data is also already in tidy format. Since it has fewer
# columns, it was relatively less messy and required less cleaning.

organizations <- read_csv("raw_data/organizations_raw.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x %in% na_strings)

# See raw_data/organizations_codebook.pdf for a detailed description of each column.

#################### Treaties ##############################

# The "treaties" data is also already in tidy format. It contains many columns
# (114), and it is unclear precisely which will be most relevant to my analysis.
# Thus, I refrained from recoding any of their values until I have a better idea
# where I want to take the final project. For now, I replaced the appropriate
# values with NA and selected the relevant columns.

treaties <- read_csv("raw_data/treaties_raw.csv") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  replace_with_na_all(condition = ~.x %in% na_strings) %>%
  select(!c(entry_id))

# See raw_data/treaties_codebook.pdf for a detailed description of each column.

#################### World Bank Stats ##############################

# I will use the wbstats() package to pull World Bank data for the countries
# involved in water treaties and conflicts. I expect that the most relevant
# measures will be population, GDP and trade as a percentage of GDP (which could
# serve as a rough proxy for international integration).

pop <- wb(indicator = "SP.POP.TOTL", startdate = 1900, enddate = 2015) %>%
  select(code = iso3c, date, pop = value) %>%
  mutate(date = as.double(date))

gdp <- wb(indicator = "NY.GDP.PCAP.CD", startdate = 1900, enddate = 2015) %>%
  select(code = iso3c, date, gdp = value) %>%
  mutate(date = as.double(date))

trade_percent_gdp <- wb(indicator = "TG.VAL.TOTL.GD.ZS", startdate = 1900, enddate = 2015) %>%
  select(code = iso3c, date, trade_percent_gdp = value) %>%
  mutate(date = as.double(date))

# See http://127.0.0.1:15723/library/wbstats/doc/Using_the_wbstats_package.html
# for a user guide on using the wbstats() package.

#################### Joining ##############################

joined <- treaties %>%
  full_join(organizations, by = "bccode", suffix = c("_treaties", "_orgs")) %>%
  full_join(events, by = c("bccode" = "bccode1"), suffix = c("_treaties/orgs", "_events")) %>%
  
  # bccode2 transfers as its own column, so it should be okay that I am only
  # merging by bccode 1.
  
  # match by year as well
  # if not annual data, create a new "decade" column that could match wb data
  # or, in wb data, could create artificial years that populate the data
  
  left_join(pop, by = c("ccode1" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c1")) %>%
  left_join(pop, by = c("ccode2" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c2")) %>%
  left_join(gdp, by = c("ccode1" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c1")) %>%
  left_join(gdp, by = c("ccode2" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c2")) %>%
  left_join(trade_percent_gdp, by = c("ccode1" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c1")) %>%
  left_join(trade_percent_gdp, by = c("ccode2" = "code", "year" = "date"), suffix = c("_", "_c2"))
